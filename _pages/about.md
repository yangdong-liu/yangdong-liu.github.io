I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate at the [School of Journalism and Communication, Nanjing University](https://jc.nju.edu.cn/main.htm), under the supervision of Professor [Cheng-Jun Wang](https://chengjun.github.io). I am also a member of the Computational Communication Collaboratory, Nanjing University. I completed my undergraduate studies at South China University of Technology, majoring in Software Engineering. My master's degree was pursued at the China Foreign Affairs University, majoring in Political Science.

My research focuses on computational narratives and AI-mediated interventions in digital communication. I study how people construct narratives—particularly causal narratives in political communication—and develop computational approaches to identify and measure how such narratives circulate within institutionalized environments and shape social and political outcomes. In parallel, I examine how generative artificial intelligence intervenes in social media interactions, reconfiguring information environments, and public participation.
