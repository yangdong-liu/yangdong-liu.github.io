I am a second-year Ph.D. candidate at the [School of Journalism and Communication, Nanjing University](https://jc.nju.edu.cn/main.htm), under the supervision of Professor [Cheng-Jun Wang](https://chengjunwang.com/). I am also a member of the Computational Communication Collaboratory, Nanjing University. I completed my undergraduate studies at South China University of Technology, majoring in Software Engineering. My master's degree was pursued at the China Foreign Affairs University, majoring in Political Science.

My research focus on China's international communication and public diplomacy, particularly the international flow of news produced by Chinese official media and the behavior of Chinese diplomats on Twitter. Additionally, I have a strong interest in causal narratives —— narratives that describe causal relationships —— in terms of their measurement within texts and their potential real-world impacts.
